In the realm of code, where Rust does reign,
A CLI app begins to take its name.
With cargo's might and lib.rs in place,
We venture forth, an eager coder’s chase.

Commands we craft, each line a sturdy beam,
Building bridges in the coder’s dream.
Tests are written, integration found,
In directories where logic’s bound.

Functions polished, modules finely tuned,
Errors handled, warnings overruled.
With every build, our confidence grows,
In Rust we trust, as our creation shows.

A journey started with a simple line,
cargo new, and now it’s time to shine.
Through trials faced and triumphs met with glee,
Our CLI app stands, in Rust, set free.

So let the terminals echo our feat,
A project done, a goal complete.
In Rust we wrote, in Rust we trust,
From first cargo to final robust.
